terraform plan
```

### Step 4: Apply Your Configuration

```powershell
terraform apply
```

## 🔍 What You'll Learn

### GitOps with Terraform

This exercise demonstrates how to:
- Set up GitOps workflows for Terraform
- Automate infrastructure deployments
- Implement branch protection and code review
- Use remote state management
- Create automated testing and validation

### Integration with Your Background

Based on your experience with:
- **GitOps workflows**: We'll extend to Terraform
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Integrate Terraform into existing pipelines
- **Code review processes**: Apply to infrastructure code
- **Branch protection policies**: Secure Terraform deployments
