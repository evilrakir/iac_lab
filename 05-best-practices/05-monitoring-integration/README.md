# Exercise: Monitoring Integration with Terraform

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Deploy monitoring infrastructure using Terraform
- Integrate Prometheus and Grafana with infrastructure provisioning
- Automate monitoring setup for Windows environments
- Understand how Terraform complements your existing monitoring expertise

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Experience with Prometheus/Grafana (you have this! 🎉)
- Terraform installed
- Basic understanding of monitoring concepts
- Access to cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) or local environment

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Navigate to the Exercise Directory

```powershell
cd 05-best-practices/05-monitoring-integration
```

### Step 2: Initialize Terraform

```powershell
terraform init
```

### Step 3: Plan Your Changes

```powershell
terraform plan
```

### Step 4: Apply Your Configuration

```powershell
terraform apply
```

## 🔍 What You'll Learn

### Monitoring Infrastructure as Code

This exercise demonstrates how to:
- Deploy Prometheus servers using Terraform
- Configure Grafana dashboards and data sources
- Set up Windows exporters automatically
- Create monitoring alerts and rules
- Integrate with your existing monitoring stack

### Integration with Your Background

Based on your experience with:
- **Prometheus/Grafana monitoring stack**: We'll automate the deployment
- **Windows Exporter**: Automate Windows monitoring setup
- **Blackbox Exporter**: Configure endpoint monitoring
- **VMware Exporter**: Integrate with VMware infrastructure
- **Alertmanager**: Set up automated alerting
